## About
This is a fork of the official phpMyAdmin add-on, made for testing stuff. Do not use, as this can break at any time.
phpMyAdmin is a database administration tool for MySQL & MariaDB. Frequently
used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes,
users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the user interface,
while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.

This add-on was specifically designed to manage the official Home Assistant
MariaDB add-on.
